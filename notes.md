Refactoring To Do:
1. Update Scraping script to save data to pickle files throughout process (done)
2. Clustering Transformation script
    - streamline transformation to add to gamelog data
3. Create script to transform and combine data for modeling
    - dir for transformed data
      - add team age feature
      - Data with each rolling ave window with clusters and without
4. Test with various rolling ave windows
5. MLP Neural Net
